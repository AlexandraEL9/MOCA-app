# [M.O.C.A- My Own Cooking App](https://your-project-link-here)

![mockup](app/wireframes/mockups.png)

Welcome to **MOCA**! All the recipes you and your family love, all in one place! M.O.C.A (My Own Cooking App) is a simple ad easy to use app I made formyself to quicky access my favourite recipes without having to search through the myriad of books, online and pinterest pages to find their details. Recipes can be added simply and searched by category or by ingredient and viewed at the click of a button!
